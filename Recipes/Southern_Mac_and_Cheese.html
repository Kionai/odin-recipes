        <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>

        <li>1 cup smoked cheddar  <em> ** trust me you don't want to skip this **</em></li>
        <li>paprika (optional)</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 F</li>
        <li>Cook macaroni until just al dente or a little under al dente.
            <em>Look on the back of the box to see how long you need to cook your
                pasta for it to reach al dente
            </em></li>
            <li>Drain pasta and set aside</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add milk, heavy cream and cheeses. (Except
                for the smoked cheddar)</li>
            <li>Stir to combine</li>
            <li>Taste the milk mixture and add salt & pepper as needed</li>
            <li>When you're content wth the taste, add the eggs</li>
            <li>Stir well until combined</li>
            <li>Butter a 9X9 inch banking dish</li>
            <li> Add macaroni into the baking dish</li>
            <li>Pour cheese mixture over macaroni</li>
            <li>Make sure the cheese is distributed well</li>
            <li>Top with the smoked cheddar. Note: This is when you can get fancy!
                Add a host of other cheeses if you'd like!
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 35-45 minutes. Do not overbake. It may be a bit jiggly when you 
                take it out of the oven but it will firm as it cools.
            </li>
            <li>Let cool for about 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
